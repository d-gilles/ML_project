## Final project of the Data Science Bootcamp (Le Wagon) October â€“ December 2022 in Cologne.

The aim of this project is to analyze the ticket sales of an indoor playground operator and to make a prediction about the expected future ticket sales. The data was provided to us by the company Tiniworld, an operator of indoor playgrounds with 64 locations in Vietnam.

The project includes the following steps:
-	Reading the raw data from a CSV file.
-	The splitting of the data, according to the different locations.
-	Train machine learning models based on these data sets.
-	Provision of the graphical evaluation of the data in a web app
